(2024, _Economics Letters_)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2024.111541) controlling for other variables. In this question, we are going to look at the _linear_ relationship between the natural logarithm of the [Automated Readability Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) (`log_automated_readability_index`) and the indicator variable that there are only men among authors (`only_males`), i.e., a **dummy variable**. _All_ your analysis should cluster standard errors at the `cluster` variable level as we did in the lectures. Similarly, the base category remains articles published in the AER, in the field of 'Microeconomics', in 2000, that belongs to the first cluster unless stated otherwise."
